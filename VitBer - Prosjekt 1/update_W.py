    """Calculates W_k+1 from W_k.
    So the input is W=W_k (d x d) as well as the centered, whitened data Zcw (dxN known as tilde{x} in the note)
    Output is the new W (W_{k+1}).
    
    This function does the two iteration steps in the note: The optimisation step and the 
    orthogonalisation (decorrelation) step. The first step you need to code, the orthogonalisation is already
    provided by the function decorrelate_weights that needs to be called.
    You can use the kurtosis version, i.e. G(u)=4*(u**3) and its derivative. Don't include the while-loop in 
    this function
